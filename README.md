# tekton demo

The goals of this repository are to showcase Tekton as a standalone CICD tool.

I'm fairly convinced that Tekton is powerful (Github Actions is amazing as well), 
but this repository aims to prove/disprove its usability for the standard developer.

I will approach this with the following use cases as a developer:

# Use Cases

1. As a developer, I need to setup a pipeline that can perform common actions (lint, build, test, deploy) trivially so that I can focus on delivering business value instead of pipeline related tasks.
1. As a developer, I need intuitive understanding of issues in the pipeline so that I can better debug my product.
1. As a developer, I need the flexibility to do "special things" in case I am not supported by the tekton maintainers at my company.
